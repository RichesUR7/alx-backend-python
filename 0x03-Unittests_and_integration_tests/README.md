 # 0x03. Unittests and Integration Tests

## Description

This directory contains projects and exercises focused on writing and executing unit tests and integration tests. The primary objective is to ensure the correctness, reliability, and robustness of code by employing various testing strategies and methodologies.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of these exercises, you should be able to:

- Understand the importance of testing in software development.
- Write unit tests to verify the functionality of individual components or methods.
- Create integration tests to check the interactions between different components.
- Utilize testing frameworks like unittest in Python.
- Mock dependencies to isolate the code under test.
- Execute test cases and interpret the results to identify and fix issues.

## Projects and Exercises

1. Introduction to Unit Testing

- Basic concepts of unit testing.
- Writing simple unit tests.
- Running tests and understanding the results.

2. Advanced Unit Testing Techniques

- Parameterized tests.
- Using setup and teardown methods.
- Testing exceptions and edge cases.

3. Mocking and Patching

- Introduction to mocking.
- Using 'unittest.mock' to replace dependencies.
- Patching methods and objects.

4. Integration Testing

- Concepts of integration testing.
- Writing integration tests to check the interaction between components.
- Setting up and tearing down integration test environments.

5. Continuous Integration

- Overview of continuous integration.
